### Saje ###

A generic application platform, with an architecture loosely based on that of the popular multi-protocol instant messenger [Miranda](http://miranda-im.org). It is implemented in pure [Qt](http://www.qtsoftware.com) (c++) and will therefore run on multiple platforms including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

Current functionality includes a minimal **Jabber** client, with SSL and MD5-DIGEST authentication (meaning it can be used with google talk and most jabber hosts), support for multiple accounts and jabber 'transports'.

The core program is just a plugin loader - all functionality is made available via plugins. This enforces modularity and ensures well defined component interaction via interfaces.
